# Project 3: Spots

## Project Overview

This webpage is the first step in a series of projects to design an image sharing app called "Spots." In this stage, we see the basic structure of the webpage. The code used is meant to accurately represent a provided Figma design. We see the logo, a user profile, and some sample images uploaded by the user. Another key piece of the project is the responsive design, showing how the page reacts by reducing the desktop view to a mobile screen view.

## HTML and CSS

This project is a web page designed to demonstrate HTML and CSS skills, as well as exhibit responsive design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The webpage adapts to various screen sizes
- **Typography Styling:** uploaded font styles, sizes, and spacing to enhance readability.
- **CSS Flexbox and Grid Layouts:** Use of Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout alignment and positioning.
- **Animations and Transitions:** Smooth hover effects and transitions on various elements for better user experience.
- **BEM:** Block Element Methodology used in the markup, CSS, as well as the file structure.

## Future Plans for Spots

To build upon this starting point, Spots will be made more functional and interactive using Javascript.
